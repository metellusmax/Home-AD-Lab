# Home AD-Lab

## Objective

The Home AD Lab project aims to build a comprehensive home lab environment using VirtualBox that simulates a Windows Active Directory, explores how a domain environment works, ingests events using Splunk, and uses Kali Linux and Atomic Red Team to simulate adversary tactics. This project helps build your home lab environment where you can gain hands-on experience in blue team (defensive) and red team (offensive) operations and support testing detection capabilities in a controlled, realistic setting.

### Skills Learned

- Installing, configuring, and managing domain controllers
- Creating and managing user accounts, groups, and organizational units (OUs)
- Forwarding Windows event logs to Splunk
- Using Atomic Red Team to simulate real-world attacks
- Analyzing attack techniques and detection using Splunk
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Practicing password attacks and exploiting misconfigurations
- Coordinating the interaction between multiple tools and systems in a single lab

### Tools Used

- Splunk for log ingestion and analysis.
- Virtualbox for creating and running virtual machines.
- Ubuntu Server is used to host our Splunk server
- Windows 10 Virtual Machine
- Windows server 2022 Virtual Machine for Active Directory/Domain Controller
- Kali linux is used as our attacker
- atomic red to simulate adversary behavior
- sysmon to provided advance system activity logging 
- app.diagrams.net to build logical diagram 
## Steps

### 1. Create a logical Diagram and Mapping out lab
Below is the logical diagram that I used for my lab.
